# thermal-vision-AI
This project aims to democratize access to smart thermography by leveraging Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. It enables real-time temperature estimation of objects from a standard video stream or a thermal camera, by combining object detection (YOLOv8) with thermal estimation models.
